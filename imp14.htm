  <h1>Chapter 14: Probability – Important Questions</h1>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q1. A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Find the probability of getting (i) a red card, (ii) a king.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Total cards = 52. Red cards = 26. Kings = 4.<br>
      (i) P(Red) = 26/52 = 1/2<br>
      (ii) P(King) = 4/52 = 1/13
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q2. Two dice are thrown together. Find the probability of getting a sum of 7.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Possible sums of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) → 6 outcomes.<br>
      Total outcomes = 36.<br>
      P(Sum=7) = 6/36 = 1/6
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q3. A coin is tossed 3 times. Find the probability of getting exactly 2 heads.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Sample space size = 2³ = 8.<br>
      Favourable: HHT, HTH, THH (3 outcomes).<br>
      Probability = 3/8.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q4. A die is thrown. Find the probability of getting a number greater than 4.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Numbers greater than 4: 5,6 (2 outcomes).<br>
      Total = 6.<br>
      Probability = 2/6 = 1/3.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q5. A bag has 3 red and 5 black balls. One ball is drawn. Find the probability it is red.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Total balls = 8, Red = 3.<br>
      Probability = 3/8.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q6. Find the probability of getting at least one head when 2 coins are tossed.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Sample space = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.<br>
      At least one head: HH, HT, TH (3 outcomes).<br>
      Probability = 3/4.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q7. A box contains 5 white and 7 black balls. One ball is drawn at random. Find the probability that it is black.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Total = 12, Black = 7.<br>
      Probability = 7/12.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q8. Two cards are drawn from a deck. Find the probability that both are aces.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      P(1st Ace) = 4/52.<br>
      P(2nd Ace) = 3/51.<br>
      Probability = (4/52) × (3/51) = 12/2652 = 1/221.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q9. A die is thrown twice. Find the probability of getting an even number on both throws.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Even outcomes = {2,4,6} → 3/6 = 1/2.<br>
      Both throws: (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question-card">
    <h2>Q10. A family has 2 children. Find the probability that both are boys if at least one is a boy.</h2>
    <div class="solution">
      Sample space = {BB, BG, GB, GG}.<br>
      Given at least one boy → {BB, BG, GB}.<br>
      Probability(both boys) = 1/3.
