    <h1>Mathematics – Chapter 1 (Sets)</h1>
    <h2>  Important Questions </h2>

<pre>
Question 1: 
The sums of n terms of two arithmetic progressions are in the ratio 5n+4: 9n+6. Find the ratio of their 18th terms.
Solution:
Let a1, a2 and d1, d2 be the first term and the common difference of the first and second
arithmetic progression respectively.
Then,
(Sum of n terms of the first A.P)/(Sum of n terms of the second A.P) = (5n+4)/(9n+6)
⇒ [ (n/2)[2a1+ (n-1)d1]]/ [(n/2)[2a2+ (n-1)d2]]= (5n+4)/(9n+6)
Cancel out (n/2) both numerator and denominator on L.H.S
⇒[2a1+ (n-1)d1]/[2a2+ (n-1)d2]= (5n+4)/(9n+6) …(1)
Now susbtitute n= 35 in equation (1), {Since (n-1)/2 = 17}
Then equation (1) becomes
⇒[2a1+ 34d1]/[2a2+ 34d2]= (5(35)+4)/(9(35+6)
⇒[a1+ 17d1]/[a2+ 17d2]= 179/321 …(2)
Now, we can say that.
18th term of first AP/ 18th term of second AP = [a1+ 17d1]/[a2+ 17d2]….(3)
Now, from (2) and (3), we can say that,
18th term of first AP/ 18th term of second AP = 179/321
Hence, the ratio of the 18th terms of both the AP’s is 179:321.
Question 2: 
Insert five numbers between 8 and 26 such that resulting sequence is an A.P.
Solution: 
Assume that A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are the five numbers between 8 and 26, such that the sequence of an A.P becomes 8, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, 26
Here, a= 8, l =26, n= 5
Therefore, 26= 8+(7-1)d
Hence it becomes,
26 = 8+6d
6d = 26-8 = 18
6d= 18
d = 3
A1= a+d = 8+ 3 =11
A2= a+2d = 8+ 2(3) =8+6 = 14
A3= a+3d = 8+ 3(3) =8+9 = 17
A4= a+4d = 8+ 4(3) =8+12 = 20
A5= a+5d = 8+ 5(3) =8+15 = 23
Hence, the required five numbers between the number 8 and 26 are 11, 14, 17, 20, 23.
Question 3:
The 5th, 8th, and 11th terms of a GP are p, q and s respectively. Prove that q2 = ps
Solution:
Given that:
5th term = P
8th term = q
11th term = s
To prove that: q2 = ps
By using the above information, we can write the equation as:
a5 = ar5-1 = ar4 = p ….(1)
a8 = ar8-1 = ar7 = q ….(2)
a11 = ar11-1 = ar10 =s …(3)
Divide the equation (2) by (1), we get
r3 = q/p …(4)
Divide the equation (3) by (2), we get
r3 = s/q …(5)
Now, equate the equation (4) and (5), we get
q/p = s/q
It becomes, q2 = ps
Hence proved.
Question 4: 
Show that the sum of (m + n)th and (m – n)th terms of an A.P. is equal to twice the mth term.
Solution:
Let a and d be the first term and the common difference of the A.P. respectively. It is known
that the kth term of an A.P. is given by
ak = a +(k -1)d
Therefore, am+n = a +(m+n -1)d
am-n = a +(m-n -1)d
am = a +(m-1)d
Hence, the sum of (m + n)th and (m – n)th terms of an A.P is written as:
am+n+ am-n = a +(m+n -1)d + a +(m-n -1)d
= 2a +(m + n -1+ m – n -1)d
=2a+(2m-2)d
=2a + 2(m-1)d
= 2 [a + (m-1)d] 
= 2 am [since am = a +(m-1)d] 
Therefore, the sum of (m + n)thand (m – n)th terms of an A.P. is equal to twice the mth term.
Question 5:
Find the sum of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 2 or 5.
Solution:
The integers from 1 to 100, which are divisible by 2, are 2, 4, 6 ….. 100.
This forms an A.P. with both the first term and common difference equal to 2.
⇒ 100=2+(n-1)2
⇒ n= 50
Therefore, the sum of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 2 is given as:
2+4+6+…+100 = (50/2)[2(2)+(50-1)(2)] 
= (50/2)(4+98)
= 25(102)
= 2550
The integers from 1 to 100, which are divisible by 5, 10…. 100
This forms an A.P. with both the first term and common difference equal to 5.
Therefore, 100= 5+(n-1)5
⇒5n = 100
⇒ n= 100/5
⇒ n= 20
Therefore, the sum of integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 2 is given as:
5+10+15+…+100= (20/2)[2(5)+(20-1)(5)] 
= (20/2)(10+95)
= 10(105)
= 1050
Hence, the integers from 1 to 100, which are divisible by both 2 and 5 are 10, 20, ….. 100.
This also forms an A.P. with both the first term and common difference equal to 10.
Therefore, 100= 10+(n-1)10
⇒10n = 100
⇒ n= 100/10
⇒ n= 10
10+20+…+100= (10/2)[2(10)+(10-1)(10)] 
= (10/2)(20+90)
= 5(110)
= 550
Therefore, the required sum is:
= 2550+ 1050 – 550
= 3050
Hence, the sum of the integers from 1 to 100, which are divisible by 2 or 5 is 3050.
